A gated graph convolutional network (GGCN) is developed for multi-sensor signal fusion and RUL prediction. Firstly, spatialâ€“temporal graphs
are constructed from multi-sensor signals as input of the prognosis model. Next, gated graph convolutional layers are built to accurately 
extract degradation features by simultaneously modeling the temporal and spatial dependencies in multi-sensor signals. Finally, the extracted
features are fed into a quantile regression layer to estimate the RUL and its confidence interval.
